# Simple-Port-Scanner-

This script is a CYB 333 Project 12/14/2021

The code functions as a port scanner. I chose to write a simpole port scanner because of their ability to detect vulnerabilities, and how important that is in cybersecurity.

Vulnerability scanning is the process of finding security flaws and vulnerabilities in computer systems and software. Scanning is an integral feature of any vulnerability management strategy. An organization's overall purpose is to prevent data breaches and the release of sensitive information. Security professionals use port scanning to identify any security vulnerabilities on a network since it identifies open ports and services available on that network.
